# Day 2 - Dart & Flutter Fundamentals 🚀

## 📚 **Projects Completed Today**
Today, I worked on fundamental Dart logic projects to strengthen problem-solving skills and programming concepts.

1️⃣ **Armstrong Number Checker**  
✅ A program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.

2️⃣ **Factorial Calculator**  
✅ Designed a simple logic to compute factorial of any number.

3️⃣ **FizzBuzz Logic**  
✅ Wrote logic to print numbers 1-100 with multiples of 3 replaced by `Fizz`, multiples of 5 by `Buzz`, and both by `FizzBuzz`.

4️⃣ **Palindrome Checker (String)**  
✅ Designed a program to check if a string is a palindrome.

5️⃣ **Palindrome Number Checker**  
✅ Designed logic to verify if numbers read the same backward as forward.

6️⃣ **Reverse a String**  
✅ Implemented string manipulation to reverse user input.

7️⃣ **Sum of Two Numbers with Functions**  
✅ Built reusable functions to compute the sum of two numbers.

8️⃣ **Data Type Exploration**  
✅ Practiced Dart's data type conversions and type-checking fundamentals.
